---

you can add new pages(multiple html files) by importing them into the `src/js/index.js`

### 💡 don't forget to add the entry in the webpack.config.js under plugins setion

```
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "src/index.html",
    }),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      filename: "page.html",
      template: "src/page.html",
    }),
    ... create new pages and add entry here and import them into the src/js/index.js
  ],
```

⚠️ don't forget to add the `filename` otherwise it is taken as the default entry creating a `index.html`(also overrides the actual index.html) instead of the actual filename(page.html)
